# Demo Instructions

Use the following steps to demonstrate the project during the interview or as part of the assignment:

1. Open [Programiz Online C Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/)
2. Paste the content of `main.c` into the editor.
3. Click the **Run** button.
4. Observe the following:
   - Each second shows how many random bytes were generated and their values.
   - Every 10 seconds, the system checks if there are at least 50 bytes.
     - If yes: it prints the latest 50 bytes and deletes them.
     - If no: it displays a message skipping the print.

For a quick preview, refer to `docs/output-sample.txt` (captured from a simulated run).
