Assumptions

This document outlines key assumptions made in the implementation of the sensor buffer simulation project.

1. Timing Simulation:
   - Real-time 1-second intervals are simulated via a loop.
   - No use of OS-level timers or `sleep()` to ensure compatibility with online compilers.

2. Random Data Generation:
   - Sensor data is randomly generated using `rand()`.
   - Every second, the number of bytes added is between 0 and 5.
   - Each byte is a random value between 0x00 and 0xFF.

3. Buffer Management:
   - The buffer is a fixed-size array with a maximum of 1024 bytes.
   - Only the latest 50 bytes are printed (if available) every 10 seconds.
   - These 50 bytes are removed after printing.

4. Platform:
   - Code is designed to run on any standard C compiler.
   - Specifically tested on: https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/

5. Duration:
   - The simulation runs for 100 seconds (adjustable in code).
